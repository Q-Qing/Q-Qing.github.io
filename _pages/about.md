I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My supervisor is Professor [Weiqiang Sun](http://front.sjtu.edu.cn/~sunwq/FRONT/huan_ying.html). I received my BE degree from the School of Information and Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. 
The proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices has enabled a rich collection of longitudinal health data, such as exercise data, heart rate, calorie expenditures, sleep, etc.
Based on the characteristics of data, our works try to improve and innovate the existing machine learning algorithms to mine individual's living habits intelligently and provide effective and personalised services.
